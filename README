An experiment to improve multithreading performance of hunchentoot
without any additional dependencies.

I'm going to try to reuse threads within connections, by sharing the
listen socket.


How to use:

```
(let* ((taskmaster
      	 (make-instance 'hunchentoot-recycle:recycling-taskmaster
                        :initial-thread-count 8))
       (acceptor (make-instance 'hunchentoot-recycle:parallel-easy-acceptor
                                :port 4242
                                :taskmaster taskmaster)))
  (hunchentoot:start acceptor))
```

TODO:

- make a small hacked version of one-thread-per-connection-taskmaster,
  just taking an advantage of atimic operators of bordeaux-threads.

- to do it:
  1. try use atomic-ops at the constructor.
  2. If "not-implemented" was signaled, simply raises an error.
