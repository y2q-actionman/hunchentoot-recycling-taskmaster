An experiment to improve multithreading performance of hunchentoot
without any additional dependencies.

I'm going to try to reuse threads within connections, by sharing the
listen socket.

TODO:

- make a small hacked version of one-thread-per-connection-taskmaster,
  just taking an advantage of atimic operators of bordeaux-threads.

- to do it:
  1. try use atomic-ops at the constructor.
  2. If "not-implemented" was signaled, simply raises an error.
